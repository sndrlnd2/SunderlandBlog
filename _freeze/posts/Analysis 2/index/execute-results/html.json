How has the consumption of different types of alcohol changed over time in Russia?\n2.  Can the consumption of one type of alcohol (ex. vodka) predict the consumption of other types (ex. beer, wine, or total alcohol)?\n\n\n\n\n\n# Research Question 1\n\n### Data visualization\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 1**. Line plot of trends in Alcohol Consumption in Russia (2017–2023) across all alcohol types show that beer consumption remains consistently high with only a slight upward trend over time, with the other alcohol types appearing stable across time.\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 2.** Trends in Alcohol Consumption in Russia (2017–2023), excluding beer, highlight a very slight increase in the consumption of vodka, wine, and liqueuers. Other alcohol types, such as sparkling wine and cider, show minimal changes.\n\n---\n\n# Research Question 2\n\n### Data Visualization\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 3.** Scatter plot showing relationship between vodka and beer consumption. A positive trend here suggests that higher consumption of vodka is associated with higher beer consumption. This suggests a relationship between the consumption of different types of alcohol. However, statistical analysis is needed to fully understand the nature of this relationship.\n\n---\n\n### Correlation Matrix\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 4.** Correlation matrix showing the relationships between different alcohol beverages. There are strong positive correlations between wine and sparkling wine (0.82), brandy and sparkling wine (0.87), and vodka and brandy (0.76), suggesting that higher consumption of one is associated with higher consumption of the other. Moderate correlations are also present between beer and other alcohol types, such as vodka (0.68).\n\n---\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Total.alcohol.consumption..in.liters.of.pure.alcohol.per.capita. ~ \n    Vodka + Beer + Wine + Sparkling.wine + Brandy + Liqueurs + \n        Сider, data = Russia_data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.91285 -0.09734 -0.00824  0.09229  0.71366 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

The results indicate that vodka (coefficient = 0.4293), beer (0.0550), wine (0.2114), brandy (0.4388), liqueurs (0.3422), and sparkling wine (0.0653) all have statistically significant positive relationships with total alcohol consumption (p \\< 0.001), while cider does not show a significant effect (p = 0.1862). The model explains 99.53% of the variance in total alcohol consumption (R-squared = 0.9953), suggesting that most of the variation in total alcohol consumption can be attributed to these beverage categories.\n",
