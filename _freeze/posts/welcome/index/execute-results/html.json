Preparing the data & Visualizing the variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 1**. Box plot showing the distribution of CGPA across sleep duration categories. There is no clear relationship, as the median CGPA stays relatively consistent across all sleep duration groups. This suggests that sleep duration may not have a strong impact on CGPA.\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 2**. Scatter plot showing relationship between academic pressure and CGPA. There appears to be a slight trend, with higher academic pressure associated with slightly lower CGPA, although the pattern is not strong.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2. Statistical Analysis\n\n### Correlation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 3.** Correlation matrix showing relationship between variables of interest: Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study Satisfaction, and Sleep Duration. The values range from -1 to 1 (with 0 indicating no correlation). The matrix shows weak correlations among the variables. Academic Pressure stands out as it has a slight negative correlation with Study Satisfaction (-0.11) and CGPA (-0.02).\n",
