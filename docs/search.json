My current research, under the guidance of Professor Rodriguez Zas, explores the influence of morphine and sex on genetic expression in the hypothalamus.\nOutside of the lab, I love going for walks, knitting/ crocheting, and recently diving into cooking."

    "text": "Student Depression Dataest\nData Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset/data\n\nData Description/ Variables of Interest:\n\nID: Unique Student Identifier\nAge: Age of student\nGender: Gender of student (Male, Female)\nCGPA: Grade Point Average, or measure of Academic Success\nSleep Duration: Average daily sleep duration\nAcademic Pressure: Scale from 1 (least pressure) to 5 (most pressure)\nStudy Satisfaction: Scale from 1 (least satisfied) to 5 (most satisfied)\nDepression: Does the student feel depressed (Yes/No)\n\n\nResearch Question: How do sleep duration and academic pressure affect CGPA and study satisfaction among students?\n\n\n\n1. Preparing the data & Visualizing the variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Box plot showing the distribution of CGPA across sleep duration categories. There is no clear relationship, as the median CGPA stays relatively consistent across all sleep duration groups. This suggests that sleep duration may not have a strong impact on CGPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Scatter plot showing relationship between academic pressure and CGPA. There appears to be a slight trend, with higher academic pressure associated with slightly lower CGPA, although the pattern is not strong.\n\n\n\n2. Statistical Analysis\n\nCorrelation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Correlation matrix showing relationship between variables of interest: Academic Pressure, CGPA, Study Satisfaction, and Sleep Duration. The values range from -1 to 1 (with 0 indicating no correlation). The matrix shows weak correlations among the variables. Academic Pressure stands out as it has a slight negative correlation with Study Satisfaction (-0.11) and CGPA (-0.02)."
