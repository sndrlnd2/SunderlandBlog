    "text": "Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scibearia/consumption-of-alcohol-in-russia-2017-2023\n\nData Description: Data set includes alcohol consumption information across the years 2017-2023 for different alcohol types including wine, beer, vodka, sparkling wine, brandy, cider, liqueurs.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow has the consumption of different types of alcohol changed over time in Russia?\nCan the consumption of one type of alcohol (ex. vodka) predict the consumption of other types (ex. beer, wine, or total alcohol)?\n\n\nResearch Question 1\n\nData visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Line plot of trends in Alcohol Consumption in Russia (2017–2023) across all alcohol types show that beer consumption remains consistently high with only a slight upward trend over time, with the other alcohol types appearing stable across time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Trends in Alcohol Consumption in Russia (2017–2023), excluding beer, highlight a very slight increase in the consumption of vodka, wine, and liqueuers. Other alcohol types, such as sparkling wine and cider, show minimal changes.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 2\n\nData Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Scatter plot showing relationship between vodka and beer consumption. A positive trend here suggests that higher consumption of vodka is associated with higher beer consumption. This suggests a relationship between the consumption of different types of alcohol. However, statistical analysis is needed to fully understand the nature of this relationship.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Correlation matrix showing the relationships between different alcohol beverages. There are strong positive correlations between wine and sparkling wine (0.82), brandy and sparkling wine (0.87), and vodka and brandy (0.76), suggesting that higher consumption of one is associated with higher consumption of the other. Moderate correlations are also present between beer and other alcohol types, such as vodka (0.68).\n\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Total.alcohol.consumption..in.liters.of.pure.alcohol.per.capita. ~ \n    Vodka + Beer + Wine, data = Russia_data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.10772 -0.13759  0.01251  0.14529  0.73872 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Linear regression model predicting total alcohol consumption based on vodka, beer, and wine consumption. The results indicate that vodka consumption has the strongest positive relationship with total alcohol consumption (coefficient = 0.47), followed by wine (0.33) and beer (0.056). The model explains 99.17% of the variance in total alcohol consumption (R-squared = 0.9917), demonstrating an excellent fit. All predictors are statistically significant, highlighting their importance in driving total alcohol consumption."

Preparing the data & Visualizing the variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Box plot showing the distribution of CGPA across sleep duration categories. There is no clear relationship, as the median CGPA stays relatively consistent across all sleep duration groups. This suggests that sleep duration may not have a strong impact on CGPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Scatter plot showing relationship between academic pressure and CGPA. There appears to be a slight trend, with higher academic pressure associated with slightly lower CGPA, although the pattern is not strong.\n\n\n\n2.

Sleep Duration categories mostly do not significantly impact CGPA, except for ‘More than 8 hours,’ which is associated with a significant decrease of 0.083 in CGPA (p = 0.0018).\nAcademic Pressure shows a small but significant negative effect on CGPA, with every one-unit increase associated with a decrease of 0.024 (p = 0.0002).\nImportantly, the model explains only less than 0.1% of the variation in CGPA (R-squared = 0.0009943), meaning that other variables not included in the model play a more substantial role in predicting CGPA.\n\nModel 2.

The intercept indicates that students with the reference Sleep Duration (5-6 hours) and no Academic Pressure have an average Study Satisfaction score of 3.29.\nSleep Duration categories do not significantly affect Study Satisfaction, as none of the categories show significant p-values. Academic Pressure, however, has a substantial and significant negative effect on Study Satisfaction, with each one-unit increase in Academic Pressure associated with a decrease of 0.109 in Study Satisfaction (p &lt; 2e-16).\nThis model explains only 1.2% of the variation in Study Satisfaction (R-squared = 0.01244), meaning that other factors not included in the model contribute significantly to variations in Study Satisfaction."
