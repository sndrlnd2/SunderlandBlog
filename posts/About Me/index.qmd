My name is Gloria Sunderland, and Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My current research, under the guidance of Professor Rodriguez-Zas, explores the influence of morphine and sex on genetic expression in the hypothalamus.

Outside of the lab, I love going for walks, knitting/ crocheting, and recently diving into cooking.
